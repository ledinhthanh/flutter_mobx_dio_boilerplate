  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  #  assets:
  #    - assets/images/
  #    - assets/icons/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  #  fonts:
  #    - family: ProductSans
  #      fonts:
  #        - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Regular.ttf
  #        - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Italic.ttf
  #          style: italic
  #        - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Bold.ttf
  #          weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
